# Incorrect Null Handling in Addition Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving the incorrect handling of null values in a function designed to add two numbers. The function `foo` returns 0 when either input `a` or `b` is null. This is not always the desired behavior.  A more robust solution would either throw an error or explicitly return null to indicate an invalid input. This example highlights the importance of explicitly handling null or undefined values to prevent unexpected behavior and potential errors in your code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation.
